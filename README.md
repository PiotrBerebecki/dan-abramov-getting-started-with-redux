# Getting Started with Redux - Notes and Code Snippets

This repository includes notes and code snippets from an excellent course: **Getting Started with Redux** (https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux) by **Dan Abramov**.

You can also play with the code snippets at: http://codepen.io/collection/AKkZNE/

Ideas covered include:

* Immutable state
* Describing state changes with actions
* Pure vs impure functions
* Reducer
* expect assertions library (https://github.com/mjackson/expect)
* Store methods: getState(), dispatch(), and subscribe()
* Avoiding array mutations with ...spread, concat(), slice()
* Avoiding object mutations with ...spread and Object.assign()
* Reducer composition with arrays
* Reducer composition with objects
* Reducer composition with combineReducers()
* Implementing combineReducers() from scratch
* Presentational vs Container components
* Passing the store down with <Provider>
* Generating containers with connect()

Special thanks to [@tayiorbei](https://github.com/tayiorbeii) for curating the notes.
